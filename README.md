# Natural Tucker Bakery Website (Restructured with React)

## Overview

This repository contains the ongoing restructuring of the [Natural Tucker Bakery Website](https://natural-tucker-bakery.netlify.app/) using **React**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **TypeScript**. The original website was built using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. This project aims to modernise the frontend architecture, improve maintainability, and potentially lay the groundwork for future full-stack expansion.

This is currently a work-in-progress, and not all features of the original website may be fully implemented yet.

## Technologies Being Used

- **React:** A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for rapid styling.
- **TypeScript:** A superset of JavaScript that adds static typing.
- **JavaScript:** The primary programming language for frontend development.
- **(Potentially) Redux Toolkit:** For state management.

## Motivation for Restructuring

As mentioned in the future goals for the original Natural Tucker Bakery website project, the aim is to "**Restructure frontend with React** and expand into a full-stack application with Node.js (Express), MongoDB, shopping cart, payment system, and user authentication". This restructuring with React and now **TypeScript** is the first step towards achieving these goals.

Using **React** will allow for a more component-based and efficient development process, making the codebase more organised and easier to manage for future updates and feature additions. **Tailwind CSS** will enable rapid and consistent styling, improving the visual development workflow [outside information]. Introducing **TypeScript** will enhance code quality and maintainability by providing static typing.

## Current Status

This project is currently under active development. Key areas of focus include:

- Rebuilding the existing website components using **React** and **TypeScript**.
- Styling the components with **Tailwind CSS**.
- Ensuring responsiveness similar to the original website.
- (Potentially) Implementing state management with Redux Toolkit for more dynamic elements.

## Future Goals (as per original project)

The long-term goals for this website include:

- Expanding into a full-stack application with Node.js (Express) for the backend.
- Utilising MongoDB for database management.
- Implementing a shopping cart functionality.
- Integrating a payment system.
- Adding user authentication.

This **React** and **TypeScript** restructuring is a fundamental step towards realising these future enhancements.

## Please note:

This restructuring of the Natural Tucker Bakery website using React, Tailwind CSS, and TypeScript is a personal project undertaken to further my front-end development skills. This is not the official website of Natural Tucker Bakery. The original website can be found here: [https://www.naturaltuckerbakery.com.au/].
